# Out-of-stock–aware procurement planning

**Branch:** `claude/oos-aware-planning`
**Status:** Spec / not yet implemented
**Author:** (drafted with Claude)

## Problem

Today a buyer only discovers an item is out of stock at the very end of the
flow — after clicking **Build cart**, when they open the supplier's product page
and find it unavailable (see the Build-cart leftovers modal). By then they've
already committed to a supplier mix. We want to surface availability **during
procurement planning** and let the buyer move an out-of-stock line to the
next-best in-stock supplier with one click, before the handoff is frozen.

## Goals

- Show each plan line's availability inline (not just on the PDP).
- When a line's chosen supplier can't fulfill it, offer a one-click switch to the
  next-best **in-stock** offer, honoring the active buying strategy.
- Provide a bulk "reassign all out-of-stock items" action.
- Never let an unavailable line silently land in a supplier handoff.
- Keep the buyer in control — recommend the swap, don't auto-apply it silently.

## Non-goals (this spec)

- Real-time stock for non-Shopify suppliers (NetSuite/ASP/etc.) — no live feed
  exists; we rely on ingestion availability for those.
- Variant-level SKU→Shopify-variant matching correctness (a real but separable
  bug; see [Follow-ups](#follow-ups)).
- Backorder ETA / lead-time modeling.

## What already exists (reuse, don't rebuild)

| Capability | Where |
|---|---|
| `availability` enum on price snapshots: `in_stock \| limited \| backordered \| unknown` | `medusa-backend/apps/backend/src/modules/tracedds/models/supplier-price-snapshot.ts:12` |
| Availability surfaced on **search** offers | `.../api/tracedds/products/search/route.ts:86,176` |
| FE pill helper `availabilityInfo(value)` (in_stock→ok, limited→warn, backordered→bad, else muted) | `app/page.jsx:2462` |
| Per-line offer override `selectedOfferKey` + ranked `offers[]` per row | `app/page.jsx:4239-4240` |
| Offer detail drawers (radio pick among candidates → `onConfirmMatch({selectedOfferKey})`) | `app/page.jsx:4420-4630`, `4888-5000` |
| Strategy-aware best-offer pick `pickBestOffer(offers, prefs, item)` | `app/page.jsx:3974` |
| Optimizer + candidate pool for bulk reassignment `optimizeLandedAssignment` / `candidatePool` | `app/page.jsx:4077`, `~4126` |
| Plan "included vs unresolved" partition | `app/page.jsx:2061` (`ProcurementPlanView`) |

### The gap

`availability` reaches the **PDP** (via the search route) but **not** the
reorder-list / plan rows, because the **match** path drops it at two layers:

1. **Backend match offer** — `buildOffers()` / the candidate SQL in
   `medusa-backend/apps/backend/src/matching/line-items.ts:~303-340` selects
   `price.price_cents` but **not** `price.availability`, and `OfferView` has no
   availability field.
2. **Proxy** — `toOffer()` in `app/api/requests/route.js:49` maps `imageUrl` and
   `productUrl` but **not** `availability`.

So the whole feature begins with a thin plumb of one existing field.

## Key design decision: orderability semantics

The snapshot enum and the live Shopify check don't line up 1:1, and most of the
catalog is `unknown`. Define a single helper so every consumer agrees:

```js
// "Can the buyer order this right now?" — conservative: only an explicit
// negative signal blocks. Unknown stays orderable so we don't nuke the catalog.
function isOrderable(offer) {
  if (offer.liveAvailable === false) return false;   // live Shopify check wins
  if (offer.availability === "backordered") return false;
  return true;                                        // in_stock | limited | unknown
}
```

| `availability` | Orderable? | Plan-row badge |
|---|---|---|
| `in_stock` | ✅ | none (quiet) |
| `limited` | ✅ | "Limited stock" (warn, amber) |
| `unknown` | ✅ | none on row; "Check with supplier" only inside the drawer |
| `backordered` | ❌ | **"Out of stock"** (bad, red) → triggers switch |
| live `available:false` (Phase B) | ❌ | **"Out of stock"** (bad, red) → triggers switch |

Rationale: `unknown` dominates the catalog (many adapters don't report stock),
so treating it as "not orderable" would flag almost everything. Only an explicit
`backordered` or a live negative blocks.

## Phase A — Planning (ingestion-driven). The MVP.

This phase fully delivers the requested behavior using data we already collect.
It depends only on `main` (no dependency on the Build-cart branch).

### A1. Backend: emit availability on match offers
`medusa-backend/apps/backend/src/matching/`
- `types.ts`: add `availability: string` to `OfferView` (and to the row/column
  types used by the candidate query).
- `line-items.ts`: add `price.availability` to the snapshot subquery SELECT
  (`~line 305`), carry it through `toRow`, and set
  `availability: memberRow.availability ?? "unknown"` in `buildOffers()`
  (`~line 320-340`).
- Tests: extend the matching unit spec so a backordered snapshot surfaces
  `availability: "backordered"` on the offer.

> Note: the **search** route already does this; we're bringing the match route to
> parity.

### A2. Proxy + row plumbing
- `app/api/requests/route.js` `toOffer()` (`:49`): add
  `availability: offer.availability || "unknown"`.
- `app/page.jsx` match-row mapping (`~:4239`): include `availability` on each
  entry of `offers[]`, and compute a row-level
  `availability = chosen?.availability ?? best?.availability ?? "unknown"` so the
  row knows its **selected** offer's status. Also carry `availability` in
  `offerKey`-adjacent fields and in `slimHandoffRow` so the frozen handoff keeps
  it.

### A3. Plan-row availability badge
- Render the `availabilityInfo(row.availability)` pill on each plan/reorder row
  (the live `ProcurementPlanView` rows and the supplier-group rows), reusing the
  existing pill tones. Only `limited` (amber) and `backordered`/out-of-stock
  (red) show a badge; `in_stock`/`unknown` stay quiet.
- Stamp the red/amber badge with a hover title: "Stock as of last sync — verify
  before ordering" to set expectations about freshness.

### A4. Per-line "switch to next in-stock"
- On any row where `!isOrderable(selectedOffer)`, render an inline action:
  > 🔴 Out of stock at {supplier} · **Switch to {nextSupplier} — ${price}**
- The target = `pickBestOffer(orderableOffers, prefs, item)` where
  `orderableOffers = row.offers.filter(isOrderable)`. Clicking sets
  `selectedOfferKey` to that offer's key via the existing
  `onConfirmMatch(itemId, { selectedOfferKey })` path. The row re-groups under the
  new supplier; totals/savings/landed-cost recompute automatically.
- In both detail drawers (`:4420-4630`, `:4888-5000`): annotate each candidate
  with its `availabilityInfo` pill, sort orderable-first, and visually mark
  non-orderable candidates (still selectable, for an intentional backorder).

### A5. Make availability a selection constraint — **DROPPED (decision)**
Decided **against** silently filtering OOS out of the default pick: keep
`pickBestOffer` / `candidatePool` cost-ranked and instead **surface-and-suggest**
(the A4 badge + switch). Auto-preferring in-stock would hide a cheaper-but-OOS
option, which conflicts with decision #1 ("not silent"). So A5 is a no-op in code;
the recommendation stays cost-ranked and every OOS line is shown, not avoided.

### A6. Bulk reassign banner — **DONE**
- `pp-oos-banner` above the supplier groups when ≥1 included line is out of stock
  with an in-stock alternative (`oosReassignable`):
  > **{n} items are out of stock — reassign to the next in-stock supplier.** [Reassign all]
- "Reassign all" sets each line's `selectedOfferKey` to its A4 `switchTarget` via
  `onSwitchOffer` (= `applyMatchDecision`). Summary recomputes.

### A7. All-offers-out-of-stock → unresolved — **DONE**
- Shared `isStrandedOutOfStock(row)` (`outOfStock && !switchTarget`) +
  `isPlanIncluded(row)`. Both `ProcurementPlanView` and `prepareHandoff` use
  `isPlanIncluded`, so stranded lines drop out of supplier groups, totals,
  coverage, AND the handoff. They render in the unresolved bucket with an
  "Out of stock" tag ("Out of stock at every supplier"), distinct from "No match".
- Deferred: an explicit "keep as backorder" toggle (currently stranded = simply
  excluded). Revisit if buyers want to force a backorder onto a handoff.

---

## Phase B — Confirmation (live-driven). Follow-on.

Ingestion availability is advisory and stale; the live Shopify `.js` check is the
truth for Shopify suppliers. Phase B closes the gap and connects to the existing
Build-cart work.

- Extract the Shopify variant/availability resolver (currently in the Build-cart
  branch's `app/api/cart-link/route.js` `resolveShopifyVariant`) into a shared
  helper, returning `{ available }` per line.
- **Automatic** live check on plan open (decision #3): on entering the plan, fire
  a bounded, Shopify-only live check of each line's **selected** offer, set
  `offer.liveAvailable`, and re-render badges. A live `available:false` flows
  through the **same** `isOrderable` → A4 switch flow. Bound the cost: only
  selected (not alternative) Shopify offers, dedupe by product URL, cap
  concurrency, short per-request timeout (reuse the 8s in `cart-link`), and cache
  the result for the session so re-opening the plan doesn't re-hammer. Degrade
  silently to the ingestion badge if the check fails/times out.
- The existing Build-cart leftovers modal becomes one surfacing of this signal:
  out-of-stock leftovers there should offer the same "switch to next in-stock"
  action instead of a dead "open it yourself" link.

---

## Out of scope / Follow-ups

- **Variant-SKU correctness:** `resolveShopifyVariant` grabs *any* in-stock
  variant (`inStock || variants[0]`) rather than the one matching the line's SKU.
  For products with size/color variants this can add the wrong variant or report
  the wrong availability. Fix by matching the line's SKU/title to the specific
  variant. Tracked separately.
- Freshness UX: optionally a lazy live re-check of just the selected offers when
  the plan opens (bounded N, Shopify-only) so badges aren't purely as-of-sync.

---

## File-by-file change list (Phase A)

**Backend**
- `medusa-backend/apps/backend/src/matching/types.ts` — `OfferView.availability`.
- `medusa-backend/apps/backend/src/matching/line-items.ts` — select + carry +
  emit `availability`.
- `medusa-backend/apps/backend/src/matching/__tests__/matching.unit.spec.ts` —
  coverage.

**Frontend**
- `app/api/requests/route.js` — `toOffer` carries `availability`.
- `app/page.jsx` — match-row mapping (`availability` on offers + row), `isOrderable`
  helper, `pickBestOffer` + `candidatePool` filters, plan-row badge, per-line
  switch, bulk banner, all-OOS unresolved routing, `slimHandoffRow` passthrough.
- `styles.css` — badge + switch-action + banner styles (reuse existing pill/Apply
  card classes where possible).

No DB migration required — `availability` already exists on the snapshot.

---

## Build & verification order

1. **A1 backend** → verify: POST `/tracedds/invoices/match` for a backordered item
   returns `availability` on the offer (curl against local stack / prod read).
2. **A2 plumb** → verify: a matched plan row carries `availability` end to end.
3. **A3 badge** → verify live (`/browse`, forged session): backordered line shows
   the red badge, in-stock/unknown stay quiet.
4. **A4 + A5 switch/filter** → verify: clicking switch re-groups the line to the
   next in-stock supplier; recommendation never points at a backordered offer.
5. **A6 bulk** → verify: banner reassigns all OOS lines in one click; totals update.
6. **A7 unresolved** → verify: an all-OOS line is excluded from the prepared
   handoff unless kept.

**Success criteria:** a plan containing a backordered line shows it as out of
stock, recommends and (on click) applies the next in-stock supplier, the bulk
action clears all of them, and `prepareHandoff` never freezes an unavailable line
the buyer didn't explicitly keep.

## Resolved decisions

1. **Recommend + one-click apply** (buyer-driven). No silent auto-reassignment. ✅
2. **`limited`** shows an amber badge but stays orderable and recommendable. ✅
3. **Phase B trigger: automatic** live check on plan open — bounded/throttled/
   cached (see Phase B), not a manual "Verify stock" button. ✅
